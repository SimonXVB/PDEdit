# PDEdit
### PDEdit is a simple, open-source PDF Editor made using Vite/React TS
### Available at: https://pdedit.simondev.xyz/
# Features
- Add PDF Documents
- Remove PDF Pages
- Rotate PDF Pages
- Rearrange PDF Pages
- Download the finished PDF

## Notes
- This app uses PDF.js to render the actual PDF File.
- PDF-LIB is used for all of the backend PDF editing.
- I initially wanted to add even more features to this project (e.g. adding text, drawing, adding images, etc.), but none of that ended up working out how I envisioned it, and the project had already taken up like a month of my time, so I decided to not implement them. :-)
- Enjoy ✌️
